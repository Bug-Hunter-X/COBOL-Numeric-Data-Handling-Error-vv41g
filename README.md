This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs involving the mishandling of numeric data, particularly numbers with decimal components.  The `bug.cob` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version. The error arises from an implicit truncation due to mismatched data types or incorrect decimal alignment during data movement operations. Understanding how COBOL handles numeric data, especially decimal positions, is vital to avoid similar issues.
